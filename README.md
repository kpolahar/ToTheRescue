# About ToTheRescue

To The Rescue CPR is a locally owned business run by a family friend,
Katherine Johnson. I rebuilt her website for her as a favor, because she was
trying to expand her business and was having trouble reaching some of her
potential client base. Kathy is fully qualified to teach CPR to licensed
medical professionals and to recertify them as needed every few years.
found that when she built her old website, using a However she tool
provided by GoDaddy, she was trying to give off a 'fun and not boring'
vibe, but ended up with a site that did not look professional enough for
these medical professionals to take her seriously.

For those who may be interested in before and after screenshots,
they are included in this repository:

Kathy and I sat down togther to discuss her business and her needs,
and I created a new design for her site which focused on a more clean,
professional look and added descriptions for each of her courses.

This was my first site built using the SASS framework for CSS. I have
learned a lot since I started using SASS, and have recently started using
Bootstrap 4, which also uses SASS. Please, feel free to ask me about why
I love SASS, if you want to see me get ridiculously excited about something
you may or may not care about. Seriously. Variables and functions in CSS?
What's not to love?!?!?!?!

I do have some additional work to do still on this site, but it has been
on hold, as Kathy's family has been dealing with a lot of medical issues
with various family members, and we haven't had a chance to sit down and
chat about the next stage for the site's renovations.

Future plans for the site do include an integration with Google Calendar
to allow users to add a request to Kathy for a time slot straight to a
designated requests calendar, rather than needing to call or email her.
We also plan to implement a form to allow users to submit a comment or
question to Kathy via the site which would come to her via email.

In addition to the site design, I also designed a logo for Kathy's
business, because she had been using a random cpr image from the internet,
and I wanted to giver her something that was unique to her and unique
to To The Rescue CPR. The logo featured on the site is a drawing which I
created on paper and scanned in. I then did an image trace in Adobe
Illustrator to get the basic logo shape in vector form, then hand worked
the svg until it was perfect.
